# SORTING

**Merge Sort Algorithm in C++**

**Description:**
This project demonstrates the implementation of the Merge Sort algorithm in C++. Merge Sort is a popular divide-and-conquer sorting algorithm that recursively divides an array, sorts the subarrays, and merges them to produce a sorted array.

**Features:**
Recursive Merge Sort implementation.
Sorting for integer arrays.
Efficient time complexity: O(n log n).

**Files**
- 'main.cpp': The source code implementing the merge and MergeSort functions.

**Functions:**
- 'merge(A[], lb, mid, ub)': Merges two sorted subarrays.
- 'MergeSort(A[], lb, ub)': Recursively splits and sorts the array.



**QuickSort Algorithm in C++**

**Description:**
This project implements the Quick Sort algorithm in C++, which is a highly efficient, comparison-based sorting algorithm. Quick Sort works by selecting a pivot, partitioning the array around the pivot, and recursively sorting the subarrays.

**Features:**
Efficient sorting for integer arrays.
Time complexity: O(n log n) on average.
Recursive approach.

**Files**
- 'main.cpp': The source code implementing QuickSort and partition functions.

**Functions:**
- 'partition(arr[], lb, ub)': Rearranges the array based on the pivot and returns the pivot index.
- 'quickSort(arr[], lb, ub)': Recursively applies the partitioning and sorting process.
