# SORTING

Merge Sort Algorithm in C++
Overview
This C++ program implements the Merge Sort algorithm to sort an array of integers. Merge Sort is a divide-and-conquer sorting technique that recursively splits an array into halves, sorts them, and then merges the sorted halves.

Files
main.cpp: The source code implementing the merge and MergeSort functions.

Functions
merge(A[], lb, mid, ub): Merges two sorted subarrays.
MergeSort(A[], lb, ub): Recursively splits and sorts the array.



QuickSort Algorithm in C++
Overview
This C++ program implements the QuickSort algorithm to sort an array of integers. QuickSort is a divide-and-conquer algorithm that selects a pivot, partitions the array, and recursively sorts the subarrays.

Files
main.cpp: The source code implementing QuickSort and partition functions.

Functions
partition(arr[], lb, ub): Rearranges the array based on the pivot and returns the pivot index.
quickSort(arr[], lb, ub): Recursively applies the partitioning and sorting process.
